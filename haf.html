<h1>Hoth Asteroid Field</h1>

<p>Hoth Asteroid Field is a game I developed in my C++ II programming class. We spent 5 weeks developing an engine and a game from scratch using C++.
  I saw the basics of what we created in class and decided that it would make a good endless runner asteroid game, so I took inspiration from my recent
  <i>Star Wars</i> marathon for the assets and title.</p>
